## 2. Additional Restriction: Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) – Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike

**Boycott Divestment Sanctions – Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (BDS BY-NC-SA)**

This software **must not be used** to further the Apartheid policies of Israel. Use, modification, or distribution **inside** Israel and the Occupied Territories is strictly forbidden until the demands of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement have been met:

* Israel has ended the occupation and colonization of all Arab lands occupied in 1967 and dismantled the Wall;
* Arab-Palestinian citizens of Israel have been granted full equality; and
* Palestinian refugees have obtained the right to return to their homes and properties as stipulated in UN Resolution 194.

For all other geographic regions **outside** of Israel and the Occupied Territories, use, modification, and distribution are permitted under the terms of the **BSD 3-Clause "New" or "Revised" License** above (Section 1), provided that any future use, modification, or distribution carries the above BDS restriction and abides by the ShareAlike and NonCommercial principles.

This restriction is **not** intended to limit the rights of Israelis or any other people residing outside of Israel and the Occupied Territories.

In any instance where the BSD 3-Clause License conflicts with the above restriction, the above restriction shall be interpreted as superior, and all other non-conflicting provisions of the BSD 3-Clause license shall remain in effect.
