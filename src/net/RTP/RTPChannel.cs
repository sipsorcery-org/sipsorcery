// History:
// 27 Feb 2012	Aaron Clauson	Created, Hobart, Australia.
// 06 Dec 2019  Aaron Clauson   Simplify by removing all frame logic and reduce responsibility
//                              to only managing sending and receiving of packets.
// 28 Dec 2019  Aaron Clauson   Added RTCP reporting as per RFC3550.
