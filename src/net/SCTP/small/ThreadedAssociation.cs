		 10.2.  Probing Method Using SCTP

		 In the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) [RFC2960], the
		 application writes messages to SCTP, which divides the data into
		 smaller "chunks" suitable for transmission through the network.  Each
		 chunk is assigned a Transmission Sequence Number (TSN).  Once a TSN
		 has been transmitted, SCTP cannot change the chunk size.  SCTP multi-
		 path support normally requires SCTP to choose a chunk size such that
		 its messages to fit the smallest PMTU of all paths.  Although not
		 required, implementations may bundle multiple data chunks together to
		 make larger IP packets to send on paths with a larger PMTU.  Note
		 that SCTP must independently probe the PMTU on each path to the peer.

		 The RECOMMENDED method for generating probes is to add a chunk
		 consisting only of padding to an SCTP message.  The PAD chunk defined
		 in [RFC4820] SHOULD be attached to a minimum length HEARTBEAT (HB)
		 chunk to build a probe packet.  This method is fully compatible with
		 all current SCTP implementations.

		 SCTP MAY also probe with a method similar to TCP's described above,
		 using inline data.  Using such a method has the advantage that
		 successful probes have no additional overhead; however, failed probes
		 will require retransmission of data, which may impact flow
		 performance.

				 7.2.2.  Congestion Avoidance

				 When cwnd is greater than ssthresh, cwnd should be incremented by

				 outstanding for the corresponding transport address.

				 In practice, an implementation can achieve this goal in the following
				 way:

				 o  partial_bytes_acked is initialized to 0.

				 o  Whenever cwnd is greater than ssthresh, upon each SACK arrival
				 that advances the Cumulative TSN Ack Point, increase
				 partial_bytes_acked by the total number of bytes of all new chunks
				 acknowledged in that SACK including chunks acknowledged by the new
				 Cumulative TSN Ack and by Gap Ack Blocks.

				 o  When partial_bytes_acked is equal to or greater than cwnd and
				 before the arrival of the SACK the sender had cwnd or more bytes
				 of data outstanding (i.e., before arrival of the SACK, flightsize
				 was greater than or equal to cwnd), increase cwnd by MTU, and
				 reset partial_bytes_acked to (partial_bytes_acked - cwnd).

				 o  Same as in the slow start, when the sender does not transmit DATA
				 on a given transport address, the cwnd of the transport address
				 should be adjusted to max(cwnd / 2, 4*MTU) per RTO.

		 Because an endpoint's cwnd is not tied to its Cumulative TSN Ack
		 Point, as duplicate SACKs come in, even though they may not advance
		 the Cumulative TSN Ack Point an endpoint can still use them to clock
		 out new data.  That is, the data newly acknowledged by the SACK

		 the current, unchanged value of cwnd now allows new data to be sent.
		 On the other hand, the increase of cwnd must be tied to the

		 adversely clock out more new data than what has just left the

			 RFC 4960          Stream Control Transmission Protocol    September 2007


			 C4)  When data is in flight and when allowed by rule C5 below, a new
			 RTT measurement MUST be made each round trip.  Furthermore, new
			 RTT measurements SHOULD be made no more than once per round trip
			 for a given destination transport address.  There are two
			 reasons for this recommendation: First, it appears that
			 measuring more frequently often does not in practice yield any
			 significant benefit [ALLMAN99]; second, if measurements are made
			 more often, then the values of RTO.Alpha and RTO.Beta in rule C3
			 above should be adjusted so that SRTT and RTTVAR still adjust to
			 changes at roughly the same rate (in terms of how many round
			 trips it takes them to reflect new values) as they would if
			 making only one measurement per round-trip and using RTO.Alpha
			 and RTO.Beta as given in rule C3.  However, the exact nature of
			 these adjustments remains a research issue.

			 C5)  Karn's algorithm: RTT measurements MUST NOT be made using
			 packets that were retransmitted (and thus for which it is
			 ambiguous whether the reply was for the first instance of the
			 chunk or for a later instance)

			 IMPLEMENTATION NOTE: RTT measurements should only be made using
			 a chunk with TSN r if no chunk with TSN less than or equal to r
			 is retransmitted since r is first sent.

			 C6)  Whenever RTO is computed, if it is less than RTO.Min seconds
			 then it is rounded up to RTO.Min seconds.  The reason for this
			 rule is that RTOs that do not have a high minimum value are
			 susceptible to unnecessary timeouts [ALLMAN99].

			 C7)  A maximum value may be placed on RTO provided it is at least
			 RTO.max seconds.
