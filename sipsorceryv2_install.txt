SIPSorcery Local Instance Install Instructions:

Quick Start:
------------

1. Set up MySQL database,
2. Edit proxy script.
3. Edit appservers.txt,
4. Eidt sipsorcery-allinone.exe.config,
5. Start application with: sipsorcery-allineone.exe -c
6. If everything is working the application can be installed as a Windows service using: installutil sipsorcery-allinone.exe

MySQL Database:
---------------

The only supported persistence store for sipsorcery local is a MySQL database.

Create a new MySQL database called sipsorceryv2. The required schema is in the file sipsorceryv2_schema.sql.

Once the schema is installed two records need to be added to the database before sipsorcery local can use it.

THe first insert is to create a domain that the sipsorcery local instance will recognise as its own. This does not need to be a internet resolvable hostname but if
you are going to register clients with your sipsorcery local instance you should make the domain whatever you intend to put ins as the SIP server for those devices.
The domain name can be an IP address. You can also set an alias list of ';' separated strings that will be treated the same way as the amin domain name.

insert into sipdomains values (UUID(), 'yourdomain.com', 'local;yourdomain;sip.yourdomain.com;yourdomain.com:5060;sip.yourdomain.com:5060;10.1.1.2;10.1.1.2:5060', null, '2010-02-09T13:01:21.3540000+00:00');

The second insert is to create a user record so you can login to a sipsorcery local client. Put your own values in for "your_username" and "your@email.address.com". The password in the 
insert below is "password".

insert into customers (id, customerusername, customerpassword, salt, emailaddress, adminid, maxexecutioncount, executioncount, emailaddressconfirmed, inserted, servicelevel) values (uuid(), 'your_username', 'sqVNTkteh3nm06A3LQuFdjT3YGxi5xDv', '1388.r4R+dPdzniwUXdBmypuQWA==', 'your@email.address.com', '*', 5, 0, 1, '2010-10-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00', 'Gold');

Proxy Script:
-------------

THe sipsorcery local application runs a SIP proxy which is controlled by the proxyscript.py python script file.

At the top of that file the "10.1.1.2" IP address fields need to be replaced with whatever IP address the sipsorcery local instance is running on.

Also replace the "10." on line 27 to match the local IP address.

Application Servers:
--------------------

The sipsorcery local proxy locates the SIP application servers by using the appservers.txt. For a local instance there will only be a single application server and 
the single line in the file needs to have "10.1.1.2" replaced with the local IP address of the machine running the local instance. 

Main application configuration file:
------------------------------------

The main sipsorcery local configuration file is sipsorcery-allinone.exe.config. The ssettings that need to be changed in that file are:

For the two settings below you will need to adjust depending on your MySQL server details.

    <add key="UserDataDBConnStr" value="Database=sipsorceryv2;Data Source=localhost;User Id=root;Password=password" /> 
	<add key="PersistenceConnStr" value="Database=sipsorceryv2;Data Source=localhost;User Id=root;Password=password" />
	
THe outbound proxy for the SIP application server needs to be set. Replace 10.1.1.2 with the IP address of the local machine.	
	
	 <OutboundProxy value="udp:10.1.1.2:5060" />
	 
Running:
--------

The application can be run as a console application with the command below. In console mode all log messages including dial plan traces are displayed on the console.

sipsorcery-allineone.exe -c
