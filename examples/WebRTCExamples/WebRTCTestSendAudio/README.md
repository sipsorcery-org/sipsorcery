**Usage**

This example generates a sine wave audio signal and sends it to any WebRTC peers that connect.

You will need `.Net Core` installed.

- Start the test application using:

`dotnet run`

- Open the `webrtc.html` in a browser and shortly thereafter a sine wave should be played on your speaker.
