## OpenAI Realtime WebRTC Integration Examples

The examples in this folder demonstrate integrations with [OpenAI's Realtime WebRTC endpoint](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/realtime-webrtc)

 - [WebRTCOpenAI](https://github.com/sipsorcery/sipsorcery/tree/master/examples/OpenAIExamples/WebRTCOpenAI): The simplest example. This program establishes a peer connection and feeds microphone input to the OpenAI agent.
 
 - [WebRTCOpenAIAliceAndBob](https://github.com/sipsorcery/sipsorcery/tree/master/examples/OpenAIExamples/WebRTCOpenAIAliceAndBob): An example WebRTC server application that eastablishes two connections with the OpenAI realtime endpoint and wires up their audio together. An OpenGL visualisation is used to show which agent is talking.
 
- [WebRTCOpenAILocalFunctions](https://github.com/sipsorcery/sipsorcery/tree/master/examples/OpenAIExamples/WebRTCOpenAILocalFunctions): An example WebRTC application that interacts with OpenAI's WebRTC endpoint and  utilise the [local functions feature](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling).
