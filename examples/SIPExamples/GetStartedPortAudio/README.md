This example program is an attempt to interface with audio capture and rendering devices on non-Windows platforms.

The example attempts to use a .NET Core [PortAudio](http://www.portaudio.com/) wrapper to access the audio devices.

As of writing this example has not been successful. Any assitance is welcome.
